AppJam+ is a mentorship program which assigns mentors to middle schools in Orange County to help and guide students in building
their own mobile applications through MITâ€™s App Inventor.

I worked with five middle school students to build a STEM based mobile application, which won the fan favorite award in the
final showcase.
